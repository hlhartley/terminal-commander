# Terminal Commander - the game
A web-based React game app that allows users to enhance muscle memory by repetitively typing actual terminal commands into the input box. The inspiration for creating this app came from remembering when I was struggling to switch over to MAC and when I was overwhelmed trying to remember all of the terminal commands as a Junior Developer. Therefore, I hope to help other users who are unfamiliar with MAC and MAC terminal shortcuts.

## Background / About
Terminal Commander was an individual project built using React. It required making a dataset of 30 terminal commands with associated descriptions. Then, I used the Fetch API call to import data to use directly in the app. There are 30 commands total and the tank image moves across the screen as the user types in the correct command. Once a user types in all 30 commands correctly, they win the game!
